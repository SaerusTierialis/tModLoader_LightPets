This mod contains a few light pets. Each pet has 150% brightness and passively reveals treasure (slightly better than the best vanilla light pet). Entering /reveal will toggle the passive ability on/off. This setting is saved on the character so you do not need to toggle each time you play.

Lantern Spirit:
Crafted from 1 Robe (20 Silk at a Loom), 1 Caged Lantern (found in Dungeon), 1 Carriage Lantern (found in Dungeon), and 1 Obsidian Lantern (found in Underworld).

Majora's Mask:
Crafted from 1 of each boss mask up to and including Duke Fishron.

Cog Vortex:
Crafted from 100 cogs.
